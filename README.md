Heyy humble visitor XD

My name is Lehlogonolo Tshehla and I am a first year in the University of Cape Town (It's 2025 as I type this). I'm just uploading all the pieces of code I have either managed to successfully make on my own or have had help along the way
There is nothing particularly special about what I'm doing now but I want a way to document all the things I've done and have it accessible to the greater masses (well those who find this :-D)
I have even included the assignments I was given to complete as I started coding
I hope to one day graduate and become a proper porgrammer but until then I will still have to make rookie mistakes and I am ready (hoepfully)
This is just a little rant but I hope what I've posted is some use (or not)

Anyways have a good one and goodluck to you too wondering visitor (I have a theory test tomorrow XD)
Kind Regards

Lehlogonolo Tshehela B-)
